            <h3>Step 1: Grab the PDE for a one dimensional wave</h3>
            <p>
                From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation#Wave_equation_in_one_spatial_dimension">Wikipedia entry for the wave equation</a>:
            </p>
            <p class="align-center">
                <span class="pre">u_tt = c^2 * u_xx</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The goal:</b><br>
                Get <span class="pre">u(t, x)</span>, which tells you the height of the wave at time <span class="pre">t</span> at one-dimensional position <span class="pre">x</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>How to get <span class="pre">u(t, x)</span>:</b><br>
                Get <span class="pre">u_tt</span>, the acceleration of the wave, at position x. Then integrate it into the velocity of the wave over time. Then update the value of <span class="pre">u(t, x)</span> by adding the current velocity to the previous <span class="pre">u(t, x)</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>How to get <span class="pre">u_tt</span>:</b><br>
                Easy peasy. According to the wave equation, all we need to do is set a constant <span class="pre">c</span> and multiply its square to <span class="pre">u_xx</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>How to get <span class="pre">u_xx</span>:</b><br>
                Intuitively, the second differential of <span class="pre">u</span> wrt <span class="pre">x</span> is the horizontal acceleration of the wave. The momentum of the crest, loosely speaking. For this, we need to start with a value of <span class="pre">u_x</span>, then differentiate it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>But then where do we get <span class="pre">u_x</span>?</b>
            </p>

            <h3>Step 2: Init variables needed to compute u(t, x)</h3>
            <p>
                To get the wave going, we'll need to start with a snapshot of <span class="pre">u(0, x)</span>, and the initial velocities, <span class="pre">u_t(0, x)</span>. Let's work with 10 samples on the wave.
            </p>
            <p class="align-center">
                <span class="pre">
u = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
u_t = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                This snapshot shows that currently the all the water is on the right, and there is no starting velocity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we go on and try to compute <span class="pre">u(t, x)</span> for all samples, we need to define <span class="pre">dt</span> and <span class="pre">dx</span>, the unit time and unit x position per sample, and the wave equation constant <span class="pre">c</span>.
            </p>
            <p class="align-center">
                <span class="pre">
dt = 0.1
dx = 0.1
c = 2
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                They're just arbitrary values without units for now. Just avoiding 1 to make things interesting.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 3: Apply the PDE to the variables</h3>
            <p>
                Now that we have the initial conditions set up, we can apply the PDE. Let's first compute <span class="pre">u_x</span>, as left hanging in Step 1.
            </p>
            <p class="align-center">
                <span class="pre">
    u_x[i] = (u[i+1] - u[i])/dx for i in [0, n-1)
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                So for the initial conditions we set up in step 2, we'll get the following <span class="pre">u_x</span>:
            </p>
            <p class="align-center">
                <span class="pre">
u_x = [0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0]
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we can compute <span class="pre">u_xx</span>:
            </p>
            <p class="align-center">
                <span class="pre">
u_xx = [0, 0, 0, 100, -100, 0, 0, 0]
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                In English, this tells us that the center of the wave wants to splash - the place just before the water suddenly rises wants to rise, and the place just after the rise wants to fall.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now finally we apply the wave equation and compute <span class="pre">u_tt</span>!
            </p>
            <p class="align-center">
                <span class="pre">
u_tt = [0, 0, 0, 400, -400, 0, 0, 0]
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that we know <span class="pre">u_tt</span>, we need to integrate it to get the updated <span clas="pre">u_t</span>, by multiplying each value by <span class="pre">dt</span>:
            </p>
            <p class="align-center">
                <span class="pre">
u_t = [0, 0, 0, 40, -40, 0, 0, 0]
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we integrate again to get the change in water level for each sample, and update <span class="pre">u</span>! But before we do that real quick, notice that we only have 8 values for velocity after all the differentiating. We'll just copy over the values on the edge to give us 10 values for all 10 samples.
            </p>
            <p class="align-center">
                <span class="pre">
u += [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, -4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we have a new snapshot of the wave water levels at <span class="pre">t = 0.1</span>!
            </p>
            <p class="align-center">
                <span class="pre">
u = [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, -3, 1, 1, 1, 1]
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now it's a matter of tweaking the initial conditions, the wave constant, and the number of samples to get your wave looking the way you want! ðŸ‘Œ
